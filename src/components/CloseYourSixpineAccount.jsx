      <p>
        You are about to submit a request to permanently close your Sixpine
        account and have your data deleted. Once your account is closed, all
        products and services linked to it will no longer be accessible across
        any Sixpine platforms. For example, submitting your closure request here
        will also deactivate your account on other Sixpine regional sites where
        you use the same login credentials to access services and products.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have uploaded your own content to any of our services (for
        example, images, videos, or documents), we recommend downloading a copy
        before closing your account.

            Please note: account closure is permanent, and once your account is
            closed it will no longer be available to you and cannot be reversed.
            If you close but later wish to use Sixpine services again, you will
            need to create a new account.
